# Phase 0, Step 5: Infrastructure & DevOps Strategy - Completion Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-02  
**Status:** Completed  
**Team:** Principal DevOps Engineer

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 0, Step 5 for Project Aether. All necessary infrastructure and DevOps configuration files have been created to support the full development lifecycle from local development through production deployment.

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Local Development Environment (Docker)

#### Files Created:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service orchestration for local development
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for Python FastAPI application
- `backend/.dockerignore` - Optimized Docker build context
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for React application with Nginx
- `frontend/.dockerignore` - Optimized Docker build context
- `frontend/nginx.conf` - Production-ready Nginx configuration

#### Key Features:
- **Database Service**: PostgreSQL 15 with persistent storage and health checks
- **Cache Service**: Redis 7 with health checks
- **API Service**: FastAPI with live reload and dependency on database/cache
- **Worker Service**: Celery worker for background task processing
- **Frontend Service**: React development server with live reload
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring for all services
- **Security**: Non-root user execution, proper volume mounting

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK)

#### Files Created:
- `iac/` - Complete CDK TypeScript project
- `iac/lib/iac-stack.ts` - Comprehensive AWS infrastructure definition
- `iac/package.json` - CDK dependencies and scripts

#### Infrastructure Components:
- **VPC**: Multi-AZ setup with public, private, and database subnets
- **Security Groups**: Properly configured network access controls
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: Production-ready database with encryption and backups
- **ElastiCache Redis**: High-performance caching layer
- **ECR Repositories**: Container image storage for API and worker services
- **ECS Cluster**: Fargate-based container orchestration
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access for application services
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure credential storage
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

#### Security Features:
- Database in private subnets with no public access
- IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Secrets Manager integration for sensitive data
- Security groups with restrictive ingress rules
- VPC with proper subnet isolation

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

#### Files Created:
- `.github/workflows/pr_checks.yml` - Pull request validation workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment workflow

#### PR Checks Workflow Features:
- **Backend Validation**: Ruff linting, MyPy type checking, Pytest testing
- **Frontend Validation**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checks, Vitest testing
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Build Validation**: Docker image build verification
- **Coverage Reporting**: Code coverage tracking with Codecov integration

#### Deployment Workflow Features:
- **Multi-Environment**: Staging (develop branch) and Production (main branch)
- **Container Registry**: Automated ECR image builds and pushes
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: CDK-based infrastructure updates
- **Service Updates**: ECS service deployment with health checks
- **Manual Approval**: Production deployments require manual approval
- **Smoke Testing**: Post-deployment verification

### 4. Development Workflow Support

#### GitFlow Integration:
- `develop` branch for staging deployments
- `main` branch for production deployments
- PR-based development with mandatory checks
- Automated deployments upon merge

#### Environment Management:
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Staging environment on AWS (develop branch)
- Production environment on AWS (main branch)
- Environment-specific configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize Git Repository**: Set up GitFlow branching model
2. **Configure AWS**: Set up AWS account and configure secrets in GitHub
3. **Set up Monitoring**: Configure CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
4. **Team Onboarding**: Document local development setup procedures
5. **Security Review**: Conduct security audit of IAM roles and network configurations

## Technical Notes

### Cost Optimization:
- Single NAT Gateway for cost efficiency
- t3.micro instances for development/staging
- Lifecycle policies for ECR repositories
- Appropriate retention policies for logs and backups

### Scalability Considerations:
- ECS Fargate for automatic scaling
- Multi-AZ RDS setup for high availability
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Container-based architecture for easy scaling

### Security Best Practices:
- Network isolation with VPC and security groups
- Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
- Least-privilege IAM policies
- Container security scanning in CI/CD

## Validation Checklist
