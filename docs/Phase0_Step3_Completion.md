# Phase 0, Step 3: System Architecture Design - Completion Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 0, Step 3 of the Project Aether development roadmap. This critical step focused on translating the high-level architecture from the SRS into concrete, documented designs that will serve as blueprints for the development team.

## Deliverables Created

### 1. System Architecture Diagram (`docs/architecture.md`)

A comprehensive Mermaid-based architecture diagram that visualizes:
- **Frontend Layer**: React SPA with TypeScript, Zustand, TanStack Query, and Shadcn/UI
- **API Layer**: FastAPI backend deployed on AWS App Runner
- **Worker Layer**: Celery workers on AWS ECS Fargate for async processing
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) and Redis (AWS ElastiCache)
- **External Integrations**: AWS Bedrock, Google PageSpeed, DataForSEO, and backlink providers
- **Security Layer**: AWS Secrets Manager for credential management

The diagram clearly shows data flow between components and provides a visual reference for the decoupled service-oriented architecture specified in SRS Section 4.1.

### 2. API Contract Standards (`docs/api_contract.md`)

A formal definition of RESTful API standards including:
- **Standardized Error Response Model**: `{ "detail": "Error message", "type": "error_type", "errors": [...] }`
- **Pagination Pattern**: Query parameters using `limit` and `offset` with metadata in responses
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Immediate return of `task_id` for long-running operations
- **HTTP Status Code Standards**: Clear mapping of status codes to specific scenarios
- **Request/Response Formats**: Consistent JSON structure for all endpoints
- **Security Considerations**: HTTPS-only, CORS configuration, and input validation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Mermaid for Architecture Diagrams**: Chosen for version control compatibility and ease of maintenance
2. **Offset-Based Pagination**: Selected for simplicity and compatibility with SQL databases
3. **Task-Based Async Pattern**: Allows UI to remain responsive during long operations like crawls
4. **Standardized Error Format**: Ensures consistent error handling across frontend and backend

## Next Steps

With the architecture and API standards now documented, the team can proceed to:
- Phase 0, Step 4: Database Schema Design
- Phase 0, Step 5: Infrastructure & DevOps Strategy

These architectural documents will serve as the authoritative reference throughout the development process and should be updated as the system evolves.

## Document Locations

All architectural documentation is stored in the `/projectaether/docs` directory:
- `architecture.md` - System architecture diagram and component details
- `api_contract.md` - RESTful API standards and examples
- `Phase0_Step3_Completion.md` - This completion summary
