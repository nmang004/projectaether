# **Project Aether: Full-Stack Development Plan**

Version: 2.0 (Enhanced Detail)  
Date: July 2, 2025  
Author: Lead Full-Stack Developer

### **Introduction**

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for **Project Aether**, a unified SEO intelligence platform. It is derived directly from the Software Requirements Specification (SRS v2.1) and is intended to guide the full-stack development team from initial setup through deployment and future iterations. The plan is structured into five distinct phases, each with specific objectives, actionable steps, and key deliverables.

### **Phase 0: Foundation & Architectural Blueprint (Pre-Development)**

**Objective:** To establish a rock-solid technical and operational foundation before writing a single line of feature code. This phase is critical for mitigating risk, ensuring alignment, and enabling efficient development in subsequent phases.

#### **Step 1: SRS Deconstruction & Ambiguity Resolution**

* **Objective:** Ensure complete clarity on all requirements and resolve any potential ambiguities before development begins.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Conduct a full team review of the SRS (v2.1).  
  * Create a shared document to log all questions, assumptions, and clarifications.  
  * Schedule a meeting with stakeholders to walk through the logged questions and get definitive answers.  
  * **Questions for Stakeholders:**  
    1. **FR-3 (Backlink Intelligence):** The SRS mentions "e.g., Ahrefs, Semrush, DataForSEO." Has a final decision been made on the primary backlink data provider? This choice impacts API integration details.  
    2. **FR-7 (Internal Linking):** The logic relies on the full site crawl. For extremely large sites (\>50,000 pages), should there be a page limit for the initial analysis to manage cost and processing time?  
    3. **Authentication:** The SRS mentions integrating with the company's Identity Provider (e.g., Google Workspace). Is this a hard requirement for V1, or can we start with a standard email/password system and add SSO later?  
    4. **Cost Control:** The SRS mentions defaulting to cost-effective models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku). Are there specific budget thresholds per user or per project that the system should enforce?  
* **Deliverable:** A finalized and signed-off "SRS Clarification Log" document.

#### **Step 2: Technology Stack Proposal**

* **Objective:** Formally ratify the technology stack and establish versioning to ensure environmental consistency.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Confirm the chosen stack:  
    * **Frontend:** React 18+ (with TypeScript), Vite, Zustand, TanStack Query, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Recharts.  
    * **Backend:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic V2.  
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ (AWS RDS).  
    * **Async Task Queue:** Celery with Redis (AWS ElastiCache) as the broker.  
    * **Crawler:** Scrapy with scrapy-playwright.  
  * Use Poetry (backend) and package.json (frontend) to lock all dependency versions.  
  * Create initial "hello world" boilerplate repositories for both frontend and backend to validate the core toolchain.  
* **Deliverable:** Locked dependency files (poetry.lock, package-lock.json) and two initial boilerplate repositories in version control.

#### **Step 3: System Architecture Design**

* **Objective:** Create detailed diagrams and documentation for the system architecture and API strategy.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * **Architecture:** Formally adopt the **Decoupled Service-Oriented Architecture** (SRS 4.1).  
  * **Diagramming:** Create visual architecture diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid, Lucidchart, or diagrams.net) showing the relationship between the API, Workers, Crawler, Database, Cache, and AWS services.  
  * **API Contract:** Define the RESTful API contract. This includes standardizing the JSON error response model (e.g., { "detail": "Error message" }) and establishing patterns for pagination (e.g., limit/offset query parameters).  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A set of version-controlled architecture diagrams.  
  * A markdown document defining the API contract standards.

#### **Step 4: Database Schema Design**

* **Objective:** Create and version-control the initial database schema.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Translate the conceptual data models from the SRS into concrete SQLAlchemy models.  
  * Initialize Alembic for database migrations and create the initial migration script based on the SQLAlchemy models.  
  * Document table relationships and the purpose of key columns, especially the JSONB fields.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * Python files containing the SQLAlchemy models.  
  * The initial Alembic migration script checked into version control.

#### **Step 5: Infrastructure & DevOps Strategy**

* **Objective:** Define and implement the complete CI/CD pipeline and local development environment.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * **Version Control:** Initialize Git repositories and enforce the **GitFlow** branching model.  
  * **Local Development:** Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the API, worker, database, and Redis containers for a one-command local setup.  
  * **IaC:** Initialize an AWS CDK project (TypeScript) to define all AWS resources.  
  * **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**  
    * **PR Workflow:** On Pull Request to develop, trigger jobs for: lint (Ruff/ESLint), test (Pytest/Vitest), and build (Docker image build). Require all checks to pass before merging.  
    * **Staging Deploy:** On merge to develop, automatically deploy the built Docker images to the Staging environment on AWS.  
    * **Production Deploy:** On merge to main, require a manual approval step before deploying the validated images to Production.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A functional docker-compose.yml for local development.  
  * A version-controlled AWS CDK project.  
  * Defined GitHub Actions workflow files (.github/workflows/).

* **Objective:** Implement a secure and robust user management system.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Build user registration, login, and secure password hashing (e.g., with passlib).  
  * Implement JWT generation upon login, defining the token claims (e.g., sub for user ID, exp for expiration).  
  * Create FastAPI dependencies (Depends) that validate JWTs on protected endpoints.  
  * Implement logic to securely fetch API keys from AWS Secrets Manager, scoped to the authenticated user or their project.  
* **Deliverable:** A suite of authentication endpoints (/login, /register) and a security dependency that can be applied to other endpoints.

#### **Step 3: Core Business Logic & Service Layer**

* **Objective:** Develop the primary business logic for all features defined in the SRS.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * **Crawler (FR-1):** Develop the Scrapy project. Implement logic to respectfully obey robots.txt and set appropriate user agents. Create the Celery task that invokes the crawl and updates its status in the database.  
  * **AI Services (FR-4, 5, 6, 7):** Create a dedicated ai\_service.py. Develop a version-controlled "prompt library" to manage and iterate on prompts for Bedrock models. Implement retry logic and error handling for AI model API calls.  
  * **External APIs (FR-2, 3, 5):** Develop service modules for each external API. Implement aggressive Redis caching on API responses to minimize costs and latency.  
* **Deliverable:** A set of service modules and Celery tasks that encapsulate all core business logic.

#### **Step 4: API Endpoint Development**

* **Objective:** Build and document all necessary API endpoints with proper validation and response formats.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Create FastAPI routers and implement all CRUD endpoints.  
  * Use Pydantic models for automatic request body validation.  
  * Implement pagination for all endpoints that return lists of items.  
  * For endpoints that trigger long-running tasks, ensure they immediately return a task ID for status polling.  
  * Review and annotate the auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for clarity.  
* **Deliverable:** A complete and documented API surface area that fulfills the frontend's data requirements.

#### **Step 5: Unit & Integration Testing**

* **Deliverable:** A running React application with a Storybook instance documenting the initial set of UI components.

#### **Step 2: Client-Side Scaffolding**

* **Objective:** Set up the core architecture of the single-page application for routing, state, and API communication.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Configure react-router-dom for all application routes.  
  * Implement a "Protected Route" component that checks for an auth token before rendering a page.  
  * Set up a Zustand store for global state (e.g., user info, auth token).  
  * Create a centralized Axios instance configured with the API base URL and interceptors to automatically attach the auth token to requests.  
* **Deliverable:** A navigable application shell with working authentication and routing logic.

#### **Step 3: Component & View Development**

* **Objective:** Build out all pages, components, and user workflows with a focus on accessibility and user experience.  
* **Key Tasks:**  
  * Develop views for each major feature (Site Audit, Content Brief Generator, etc.).  
  * Build complex, reusable components like data tables with sorting/filtering and interactive charts with Recharts.  
  * Ensure all interactive components are fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), using semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes.  
* **Deliverable:** Completed UI for all features specified in the SRS.

#### **Step 4: API Integration & State Management**

* **Objective:** Seamlessly connect the UI to the backend API and provide users with clear feedback on data states.  
* **Key Tasks:**
