   - **Status:** All required `data-testid` attributes have been added to LoginPage.tsx and DashboardPage.tsx
   - **Implementation:** Includes email-input, password-input, login-button, welcome-header, logout-button, keyword-textarea, generate-clusters-button, loading-indicator, results-container, cluster-group, primary-keyword, related-keyword-list, and related-keyword-item
   - **Result:** E2E tests can now execute successfully

2. **Playwright Configuration âœ… RESOLVED**
   - **Status:** Complete Playwright configuration file created at `/e2e-tests/playwright.config.ts`
   - **Implementation:** Supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), authentication state management, and proper test orchestration
   - **Result:** E2E test execution framework is fully operational

3. **CI/CD Pipeline âœ… RESOLVED**
   - **Status:** Comprehensive CI/CD workflow implemented at `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
